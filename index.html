<h1>My Dog is Cute</h1>

<img src="belle1.jpg" height="500" />

<p>This is my dog Belle, isn't she cute? She is a <a href="http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Basset_Hound">Basset Hound</a>. Belle is a bacon stealer: She will stand on her hind legs, and since she is long she will be very high and then she will be able to steal the bacon off the counter.</p>
