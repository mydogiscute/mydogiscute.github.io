<h1>My Dog is Cute</h1>

<img src="belle1.jpg" height="500" />

<p>This is my dog Belle, isn't she cute? She is a <a href="http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Basset_Hound">Basset Hound</a>. Belle is a bacon stealer: She will stand on her hind legs, and since she is long she will be very high and then she will be able to steal the bacon off the counter. Obviously she likes bacon.</p>
